        <h3>Activities</h3>
        <p>There are many things that you can do in the 100 Acre Woods. This includes spending a day with Christopher Robin and Pooh, reading with Owl, gardening with Rabbit, having tea at Piglet's, talking with Eeyore, having dinner with Kanga and Roo, and excersizing with Tigger.<br>
        Everyone loves spending time with eachother so these are some ideas. Spending time all together is the best way to pass time.</p>
        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <p>There are rumors that there are Heffalumps wandering the woods, but dont be afraid, they are very kind and friendly. Please be respectful and kind to them because when enraged, they are dangerous. <br> Also, please be aware that there may be a gopher at times, however he is not in the story so do not worry about him. <br>
        The most important is that <strong><em>No Parents are Allowed</em></strong> </p>
